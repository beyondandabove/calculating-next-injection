# calculating-next-injection
If you get injections in regular or semi-regular intervals, this will do the calculation for you. (German)
For non-German speakers, it basically says this:
- "When was your last injection? (Format: DD.MM.YYYY)"
- "How long is your interval (in weeks)?"
- "Your next injection is on (projected date)."

-----
I get injections in long intervals, so calculating when my next injection is due can become very tedious and prone to errors.
So I have decided to write this programme to do the calculations for me.

-----
I am only a beginner in Python, so this code is very basic, but I have plans to add the following eventually:
- proper error handling
- allowing user to enter date in more than one format
- allowing user to enter intervals other than weeks
- compatibility with different language formats (currently set to de_DE)

VERS 1.0
- Ability to enter a date and an interval (in weeks) to calculate projected next injection date.
